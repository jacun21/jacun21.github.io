        <p class="about-me-card-text">
        I am currently a Bioinformatics Analyst at the Integrative Cardiovascular Metabolism and Pathophysiology (iCaMP) Laboratory at Boston University. My work focuses on mitochondrial genetics and cardiovascular disease, leveraging bioinformatics tools to analyze data from large cohorts like the Framingham Heart Study and UK Biobank.
        <br><br>
        Before this role, I was a Post-Baccalaureate IRTA Research Fellow at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. There, I contributed to studies on platelet reactivity and arterial stiffness measures, along with a Transcriptome-Wide Association Study on heavy menstrual bleeding.
        <br><br>
        Beyond my professional work, I am passionate about water quality monitoring and watershed conservation. I volunteer with OARS, an organization dedicated to protecting and monitoring rivers in Massachusetts, where I gained hands-on experience in water quality monitoring techniques.
        <br><br>
        My goal is to apply computational tools not only to human health but also to environmental conservation.

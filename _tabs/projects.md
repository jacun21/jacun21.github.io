## Water Quality and Watershed Science

  <div class="ma-ej-wq-card-body">
    <h4 class="ma-ej-wq-card-title">An Exploration of Water Quality Metrics in and Around Environmental Justice Neighborhoods in Massachusetts</h4>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/ma-wq-ej-map.jpg">
    <p class="ma-ej-wq-card-text">
    This project analyzes water quality metrics (dissolved oxygen, water temperature, specific conductance, and pH) near Environmental Justice (EJ) neighborhoods in Massachusetts. Using a GIS pipeline, water quality data from up to 1,086 sampling sites was compared with demographic data, focusing on the proximity to EJ neighborhoods. Generalized linear mixed models identified significant associations between water quality variables and proximity to EJ neighborhoods, including links between specific conductance and the percent minority population in these areas. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The findings suggest potential water quality disparities that disproportionately affect minority populations, highlighting the need for further research into environmental inequities in Massachusetts. This project was completed as part of the Institutional Racism in Science and Health course (BF510, Fall 2024) at Boston University, taught by Dr. Melisa Osborne.

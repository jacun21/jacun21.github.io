## Bioinformatics

### Mitoproximal Proteins Database

- **Description**: A web application and MySQL database featuring proteins associated with mitochondrial function, identified using bioinformatics techniques by Leyfer and Fetterman [(NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqad107). This project was co-developed with Nathaniel Fisher, Sihan (Iris) Xu, and Christian Landaverde as part of the Biological Databases course (BF768, Spring 2024) at Boston University, taught by Dr. Gary Benson. 

- **Tools Used**: Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL

### Rosalind Bioinformatics Challenges

- **Description**: A series of bioinformatics challenges completed through the Rosalind platform, focusing on real-world problems like sequence alignment and genome assembly using Python. Completed for extra credit as part of the Applications in Bioinformatics (BF527, Fall 2023) course at Boston University, taught by Dr. Dmitri Leyfer.

- **Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook

- **Github Repo**: [Rosalind Bioinformatics Challenges](https://github.com/jacun21/Rosalind-Bioinformatics-Challenges.git)

## Water Quality and Watershed Science

### An Exploration of Water Quality Metrics in and Around Environmental Justice Neighborhoods in Massachusetts

- **Description**: This project analyzes water quality metrics (dissolved oxygen, water temperature, specific conductance, and pH) near Environmental Justice (EJ) neighborhoods in Massachusetts. Using a GIS pipeline, water quality data from up to 1,086 sampling sites was compared with demographic data, focusing on the proximity to EJ neighborhoods. Generalized linear mixed models identified significant associations between water quality variables and proximity to EJ neighborhoods, including links between specific conductance and the percent minority population in these areas. 

    The findings suggest potential water quality disparities that disproportionately affect minority populations, highlighting the need for further research into environmental inequities in Massachusetts. This project was completed as part of the Institutional Racism in Science and Health course (BF510, Fall 2024) at Boston University, taught by Dr. Melisa Osborne.

- **Tools Used**: ArcGIS Pro, R, glmmTMB library, R Markdown

- **Github Repo**: [MA Environmental Justice Neighborhoods Water Quality Project](https://github.com/jacun21/BF510_Water_Quality_Final_Project.git)
